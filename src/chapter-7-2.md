Self-care is critical for coping with stress and burnout. Make time for activities that you enjoy outside of work, such as exercise, hobbies, or spending time with loved ones. Prioritize sleep, healthy eating habits, and relaxation techniques, such as meditation or yoga.

Set Realistic Expectations

Setting realistic expectations is essential for managing stress and avoiding burnout. Be honest with yourself about what you can realistically accomplish in a given timeframe. Delegate tasks when possible, and don't be afraid to say no when your workload becomes overwhelming.

Establish Boundaries

Establishing boundaries is another key component of coping with stress and burnout. Set clear guidelines around work hours and availability, and communicate them to your team members. Avoid checking email or taking work calls during non-work hours, and make time for activities that help you recharge.

Seek Support

Seeking support from others is essential for coping with stress and burnout. Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings, or seek professional help if needed. Consider joining a support group or seeking out a mentor who can offer guidance and advice.
